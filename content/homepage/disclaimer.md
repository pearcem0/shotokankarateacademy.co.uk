As Karate is a physically demanding activity, students understand there is a risk of injury. Shotokan Karate Academy (‘SKA’) does not conduct health or fitness checks on students and participation in the lessons is at each student’s own risk.

To the extent permitted by law, SKA and its instructors are not liable for any loss, damage, injury or disappointment suffered in connection with lessons or any delays or failure (in whole or in part) to perform any of its obligations if such delay or failure is caused by something beyond its control, including indirect, consequential or special losses howsoever caused in connection with any aspect of the lessons. Nothing in these terms and conditions shall exclude or restrict SKA’s liability for death or personal injury caused by its negligence, fraud or any other liability to the extent it cannot be excluded by law.
