* Always bow on entering or leaving the dojo.
* Junior grades must bow first to their seniors.
* Instructors should be referred to as Sensei or by their appropriate title, and not by name.
* Nails must be kept clean and short enough to avoid scratching and cutting. Jewellery or watches should not be worn. If it is not possible to remove rings of earrings, they should be safely covered.
* It may be requested that shoes are removed on entering the Dojo.
* It is polite to walk around the edge of the training area.
* It is mandatory to walk around the edge of the training area while class is in progress.
* Students are expected to arrive on time for classes. However, if they happen to be late they should:
  1. Change into their training attire
  2. Warm up in the designated changing room
  3. Enter the dojo silently, walk briskly around the outside of the training area and kneel in front and to the side of the class, ensuring clear visibility to the Senseis
  4. Attentively watch for the Senseis' signal to participate
  5. Once the signal is given, they should continue kneeling, bow deeply, and then proceed swiftly and quietly to the back of the class until it is convenient to find a suitable position corresponding to their grade.
* Any behaviour that is likely to offend the etiquette of the Dojo is not allowed
