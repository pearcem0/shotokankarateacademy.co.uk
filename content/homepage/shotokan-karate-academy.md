Sensei Garry Harford has been running a dojo since 1982, starting in Poynton before moving to Salford and now at its new home in central Manchester. He prides himself on having taught many highly successful karate students over that time, including seasoned internationals. Garry himself was a member of the England squad which dominated European Shotokan Karate for many years, culminating in becoming World Champions in 1990.

Alongside Garry, there are a number of other instructors at the club, all experienced black belts, all willing to help you achieve your karate goals.

The Shotokan Karate Academy is affiliated with the Karate Union of Great Britain (KUGB), the largest Shotokan karate association in Great Britain. The KUGB runs many free training courses during the year and also holds annual Championships at which competitors at all levels are welcome.
