                    <p>Karate is a martial art which originated in Japan. Karate literally means &ldquo;empty hand&rdquo; and is a fighting system that involves the use of punches, kicks, strikes and blocks. Shotokan is a style of karate developed by Gichin Funakoshi, incorporating techniques from other martial arts, over a hundred years ago in the small Japanese island of Okinawa. Shotokan is a traditional martial art and is characterised by the use of deep stances and powerful moves.</p>

                    <p>Sensei Garry Harford has been running a dojo since 1982, starting in Poynton before moving to Salford and now at its new home in central Manchester. He prides himself in having taught many highly successful karate students over that time, including seasoned internationals. Garry himself was a member of the England squad which dominated European Shotokan Karate for many years, culminating in becoming World Champions in 1990.</p>
<p>Alongside Garry, there are a number of other instructors at the club, all experienced black belts, all willing to help you achieve your karate goals.</p>
<p>The Shotokan Karate Academy is affiliated to the Karate Union of Great Britain (KUGB) which is the largest Shotokan karate association in Great Britain. The KUGB runs many free training courses during the year and also holds annual Championships at which competitors at all levels are welcome.</p>

                    <ul>
<li>Always bow on entering or leaving the dojo.</li>
<li>Junior grades must bow first to their seniors.</li>
<li>Instructors should be referred to as Sensei or by their appropriate title, and not by name.</li>
<li>Nails must be kept clean and short enough to avoid scratching and cutting. Jewellery or watches should not be worn. If it is not possible to remove rings of earrings, they should be safely covered.</li>
<li>It may be requested that shoes are removed on entering the Dojo.</li>
<li>It is polite to walk around the edge of the training area.</li>
<li>It is mandatory to walk around the edge of the training area while class is in progress.</li>
<li>Students are expected to arrive on time for classes. However, if they happen to be late they should:
<ol>
<li>Change into their training attire</li>
<li>Warm up in the designated changing room</li>
<li>Enter the dojo silently, walk briskly around the outside of the training area and kneel in front and to the side of the class, ensuring clear visibility to the Senseis</li>
<li>Attentively watch for the Senseis' signal to participate</li>
<li>Once the signal is given, they should continue kneeling, bow deeply, and then proceed swiftly and quietly to the back of the class until it is convenient to find a suitable position corresponding to their grade.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Any behaviour that is likely to offend the etiquette of the Dojo is not allowed</li>
